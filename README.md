Genetic Algorithm in python 3.8

# Project Overview
Implementing genetic algorithm on a population of a given size to attain the goal of reaching a given target.

<h3>Aim:</h3>
To create a algorithm that will, by the process of evolution, teach a populaion to navigate towards a desired goal

<h3>Genetic Algorithm:</h3>

- [step 1] A population, on it's first generation is left to roam randomly inside the canvas.

- [step 2] The next generation is bred from the best performers, selected based on a fitness function of the first generation in hopes to recreate the genes that made the genomes to go in the desired direction.

- [step 3] Some genes of the next generation is mutated[randomly changed] based on a MUTATION RATE, this, in theory, will bring some variance in the behaviors of the genomes to better replicate natural evolution.

- [step 4] The above steps are followed for many generation untill the genomes are almost perfectly skilled to reach the given target due to generations of evolution and mutation.
